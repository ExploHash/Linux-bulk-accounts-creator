## Linux bulk accounts creator
I wrote this little python script for a schoolproject
## How it works
1. You create a username/password file like this:
```
username1:password1
username1:password1
username3:password3
....
username1879:password1879
```
You can also generate a random file with the `generate.py`

2. Open a terminal and run `python3 main.py [filepath]`
3. Watch it go
## Plans
1. Generate the user UUID myself because it gets slower 
2. More options
